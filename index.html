        <h2> Character Bio</h2>
           Katara is a waterbending master, born in the Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife Kya. 
           During her childhood, she was the only waterbender living in the South Pole and lived a peaceful life with her family. 
           This happiness was shattered, however, when Katara lost her mother in a Fire Nation raid, Kya sacrificing herself to keep her daughter safe from harm. 
           After her father left to battle against the Fire Nation in the Hundred Year War, she was raised by her paternal grandmother Kanna alongside her older brother Sokka. 
           As a teenager, Katara and her brother discovered the young Air Nomad Avatar, Aang, who had been frozen in an iceberg with his bison, Appa, for one hundred years.
           In need of a waterbending master, the siblings and Aang left the South Pole on a journey toward the Northern Water Tribe.
           She and Sokka eventually became close friends with Aang, and after their journey to the North Pole, continued to travel with him across the world as he mastered the remaining elements, earth and fire. 
           She became Aang's waterbending instructor after their departure from the Northern Water Tribe, replacing Master Pakku, who had instructed them during their time there. 
           Her mastery of water made her a formidable asset to the group. The siblings' assistance helped Aang halt the Fire Nation's ambitions of world domination, ending the century-long war, and finally restoring balance to the world.
